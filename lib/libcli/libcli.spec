%changelog
* Wed Feb 24 2021 Rob Sanders <rsanders.forcepoint.com> 1.10.7
- Fix bug were an extra newline was being inserted on every line
  when help was being requested for options and arguments
- Fix memory leak in linewrapping code for help items

* Mon Feb 22 2021 Rob Sanders <rsanders.forcepoint.com> 1.10.6
- Fix bug when a command not found in the current mode, but is found
  in the CONFIG_MODE, which would resultin an an infinate loop.  Bug
  reported by Stefan Mächler (github @machste).

* Wed Jan 27 2021 Gerrit Huizenga <gerrit@us.ibm.com> 1.10.5
- Add ppc64le to travis builds

* Wed Jan 27 2021 Rob Sanders <rsanders@forcepoint.com> 1.10.5
- Add additional range chack to cli_loop() if the 'select' call is used, and
  punt if sockfd is out of range
- Add preprocessor check (LIBCLI_USE_POLL) to toggle between using poll or
  select in cli_loop().  Code submitted on github by @belge-sel.
- Fix possible error where cli_command_name() returns a NULL by
  generating full command name when a command is registered. 
  Note - removed cli->commandname member

* Thu Jan 14 2021 Rob Sanders <rsanders@forcepoint.com> 1.10.5
- Fix issue where the help for 'long command name' winds up running into
  the actual help text w/o any spaces.  Now a long command will be on a line
  by itself with the line having the indented help text.
- Change error notification of command processing to make it clearer where
  an error was found when processing a command, rather than displaying
  all of the command elements from the offending word back to the top 
  level command. 
- Fix incorrect internal version defined in libcli.h for the 1.10.4 release
- Minor change in makefile to create rpm from source code
- Minor additions to clitest to show 'fixed' behavior above.

* Mon Jan 11 2021 Rob Sanders <rsanders@forcepoint.com> 1.10.5
- Fix display issue when optional argument fails validation, so it will show 
  the invalid *value* rather than repeat the name

* Sun Jun 7 2020 Danial Zaoui <daniel.zaoui@yahoo.com>
- Fix function prototype in libcli.h to avoid error when compiled with 'strict-prototypes'

* Tue Mar 3 2020 Rob Sanders <rsanders@forcepoint.com> 1.10.4-1
- Fix segfault issue found during tab/help processing
- Minor fix of version on previous changelog record

* Fri Jan 10 2020 Rob Sanders <rsanders@forcepoint.com> 1.10.3-1
- Minor cosmetic change to how help messages are generated, minor edits
  to some comments, minor cosmetic change to clitest demo code

* Fri Dec 6 2019 Rob Sanders <rsanders@forcepoint.com> 1.10.3-1
- Tweak to buildmode to only show optargs 'after' the point at
  which buildmode was entered.
- Add new 'cli_dump_optargs_and_args() function for development/debug
  Designed to be called from a callback to show output of optarg and
  argument processing.

* Thu Dec 5 2019 Rob Sanders <rsanders@forcepoint.com> 1.10.3-1
- Updated CLI_CMD_OPTIONAL_FLAG parsing to use an validator function
  (if provided) to determine if the word being looked is a match for
  the optional flag.  If no validator function is provided then the 
  word much match the name of the optional flag exactly.

* Thu Nov 14 2019 Rob Sanders <rsanders@forcepoint.com> 1.10.3-1
- Enhance how cli_parse_line handles quotes when parsine the command
  line.  This includs mixed single/double quotes, embedded quoted 
  substrings, and handling 'escaped' quotes using the '\' character.  
- Ensure that buildmode preserves 'empty' strings
  (ex: "", or '') when regenerating the cmdline after the user 'executes'
  the command.

  being displayed for optional argumenets

- Added completor/validator logic for buildmode 'unset' command
- Fixed bug in how help was being created in buildmode that resulted
  in badly formatted lines
- Add support so the buildmode unset command has dynamic help messages
  depending on what has already been set
- Prevent spot check optargs from appearing in buildmode
- BREAKING API CHANGE - the 'cli_register_optarg()' function is now returning
  a pointer to the newly added optarg or NULL instead of an integer 
  return code.  This is to fix a design bug where it was difficult to 
  use the new 'cli_optarg_addhelp()' function.  Only affects moving from
  1.10.0 to 1.10.2 (1.10.1 was never released)
